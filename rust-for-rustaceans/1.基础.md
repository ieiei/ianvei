当您深入了解 Rust 的更高级部分时，确保对基础知识有充分的了解非常重要。 在 Rust 中，就像在任何编程语言中一样，当您开始以更复杂的方式使用该语言时，各种关键字和概念的精确含义变得很重要。 在本章中，我们将介绍 Rust 的许多原语，并尝试更清楚地定义它们的含义、它们的工作原理以及它们为什么是这样的。 具体来说，我们将研究变量和值的不同之处、它们在内存中的表示方式以及程序具有的不同内存区域。 然后，我们将讨论所有权、借用和生命周期的一些微妙之处，在继续阅读本书之前，您需要掌握这些微妙之处。 如果您愿意，您可以从头到尾阅读本章，也可以将其用作参考来温习您不太确定的概念。 我建议你只有当你感觉完全的时候才继续前进

对本章的内容感到满意，因为对这些原语如何工作的误解将很快妨碍理解更高级的主题，或者导致您错误地使用它们。

## 讨论内存

并非所有内存都是一样的。 在大多数编程环境中，您的程序可以访问堆栈、堆、寄存器、文本段、内存映射寄存器、内存映射文件，或许还可以访问非易失性 RAM。 在特定情况下您选择使用哪一个会影响您可以在那里存储什么、可以访问它的时间以及您使用什么机制来访问它。 这些内存区域的具体细节因平台而异，超出了本书的范围，但其中一些对于您如何推理 Rust 代码非常重要，值得在这里介绍。
### 内存术语

在我们深入研究内存区域之前，您首先需要了解值、变量和指针之间的区别。 Rust 中的值是类型和该类型值域的元素的组合。 一个值可以使用其类型的表示形式转换为字节序列，但就其本身而言，您可以认为一个值更像您（程序员）的意思。 例如，类型 u8 中的数字 6 是数学整数 6 的实例，其在内存中的表示形式是字节 0x06。 类似地，str“Hello world”是所有字符串域中的值，其表示形式是其UTF-8编码。 值的含义与存储这些字节的位置无关。

值存储在一个位置，这是 Rust 术语，意思是“可以保存值的位置”。 这个地方可以在栈上，堆上，或者在其他一些地点。 存储值的最常见位置是变量，它是堆栈上的命名值槽。

指针是保存内存区域地址的值，因此指针指向一个位置。 可以取消引用指针以访问存储在其指向的内存位置中的值。 我们可以将同一个指针存储在多个变量中，因此有多个变量间接引用内存中的同一位置，从而引用相同的基础值。

考虑清单 1-1 中的代码，它说明了这三个元素。

---
```
let x = 42;
let y = 43;
let var1 = &x;
let mut var2 = &x;
var2 = &y;
```
---
*Listing 1-1: Values, variables, and pointers*

这里有四个不同的值：42（i32）、43（i32）、x（指针）的地址和 y（指针）的地址。 还有四个变量：x、y、var1 和 var2。 后两个变量都保存指针类型的值，因为引用是指针。 虽然 var1 和 var2 最初存储相同的值，但它们存储该值的单独、独立的副本； 当我们将 var2 中存储的值更改为 1 时，var1 中的值不会更改。 特别是， = 运算符将右侧表达式的值存储在左侧命名的位置。

变量、值和指针之间的区别变得重要的一个有趣的例子是在如下语句中：

---
```
let string = "Hello world";
```
---

尽管我们将字符串值分配给变量 string，但该变量的实际值是指向字符串值“Hello world”中第一个字符的指针，而不是字符串值本身。 此时您可能会说，“但是等等，那么字符串值存储在哪里？ 指针指向哪里？” 如果是这样，那么您的眼光很敏锐——我们马上就会谈到这一点。

*从技术上讲，字符串的值还包括字符串的长度。 我们将在第 2 章讨论宽指针类型时讨论这一点。*

### 深度变量

我之前给出的变量定义很广泛，而且其本身不太可能有那么大的用处。 当您遇到更复杂的代码时，您将需要更准确的心理模型来帮助您推理程序真正在做什么。 我们可以利用很多这样的模型。 详细描述它们需要几章的时间，超出了本书的范围，但从广义上讲，它们可以分为两类：高层模型和低层模型。 在考虑生命周期和借用级别的代码时，高级模型非常有用，而当您推理不安全代码和原始指针时，低级模型则很有用。 以下两节中描述的变量模型足以满足本书中的大部分内容。

#### 高级模型

在高级模型中，我们不认为变量是保存字节的地方。 相反，我们将它们视为在整个程序中实例化、移动和使用值时赋予值的名称。 当您将值分配给变量时，该值从此由该变量命名。 当稍后访问某个变量时，您可以想象从该变量的先前访问到新访问绘制一条线，这在两个访问之间建立了依赖关系。 如果变量中的值被移动，则无法再从中绘制线条。

在此模型中，变量仅在具有合法值时才存在； 您无法从值未初始化或已移动的变量中绘制线条，因此实际上它不存在。 使用此模型，您的整个程序由许多此类依赖行（通常称为流）组成，每个依赖行都跟踪某个值的特定实例的生命周期。 当存在分支时，流可以分叉和合并，每个分支都跟踪该值的不同生命周期。 编译器可以检查程序中任何给定点，所有可以并行存在的流程是否兼容。 例如，不能存在两个对某个值具有可变访问权限的并行流。 也不可能存在借用值的流，同时不存在拥有该值的流。 清单 1-2 显示了这两种情况的示例。

---
``` rust
let mut x;
// this access would be illegal, nowhere to draw the flow from:
// assert_eq!(x, 42);

x = 42;  
// this is okay, can draw a flow from the value assigned above:

let y = &x;  
// this establishes a second, mutable flow from x:

x = 43;  
// this continues the flow from y, which in turn draws from x. // but that flow conflicts with the assignment to x!

assert_eq!(*y, 42);  
```
---
*Listing 1-2: Illegal flows that the borrow checker will catch*

首先，我们不能在 x 初始化之前使用它，因为我们没有地方可以从中获取流。 只有当我们给 x 赋值时，我们才能从中得出流量。 此代码有两个流：一个从 1 到 3 的独占 (&mut) 流，以及一个从 1 到 2 到 4 的共享 (&) 流。借用检查器检查每个流的每个顶点，并检查是否没有其他不兼容的流同时存在。 在这种情况下，当借用检查器检查 3 处的独占流时，它会看到在 4 处终止的共享流。由于您不能同时对某个值进行独占和共享使用，因此借用检查器（正确地）拒绝 代码。 请注意，如果 4 不存在，则此代码可以正常编译！ 共享流将在 2 处终止，并且当在 3 处检查独占流时，不会存在冲突流。

如果声明的新变量与前一个变量同名，它们仍被视为不同的变量。 这称为遮蔽——后一个变量以相同的名称“遮蔽”前一个变量。 这两个变量共存，尽管后续代码不再能够命名前一个变量。 该模型大致匹配编译器（尤其是借用检查器）关于程序的原因，并且实际上在编译器内部使用以生成高效的代码。

#### 低级模型

变量命名可能包含或不包含合法值的内存位置。 您可以将变量视为“值槽”。 当您分配给它时，该插槽将被填充，并且其旧值（如果有）将被删除并替换。 当您访问它时，编译器会检查该槽是否不为空，因为这意味着该变量未初始化或其值已被移动。 指向变量的指针引用变量的后备内存，并且可以取消引用以获取其值。 例如，在语句 let x: usize 中，变量 x 是堆栈上内存区域的名称，该区域有空间容纳 usize 大小的值，尽管它没有明确定义的值（其槽位） 是空的）。 如果您为该变量分配一个值，例如 x = 6，则该内存区域将保存代表值 6 的位。当您分配给 x 时，&x 不会改变。 如果您声明多个具有相同名称的变量，它们最终仍然会有不同的内存块支持它们。 此模型与 C 和 C++ 以及许多其他低级语言使用的内存模型相匹配，当您需要显式推理内存时非常有用。

*Note. 在此示例中，我们忽略 CPU 寄存器并将其视为优化。 实际上，如果该变量不需要内存地址，则编译器可以使用寄存器来支持变量而不是内存区域。*

您可能会发现其中一个比另一个更符合您之前的模型，但我强烈建议您尝试同时了解它们。 它们都同样有效，而且都是简化，就像任何有用的心智模型一样。 如果您能够从这两个角度考虑一段代码，您会发现更容易处理复杂的代码段并理解它们为什么或不按您的预期编译和工作。


You may find that one of these matches your previous model better than the other, but I urge you to try to wrap your head around both  of them. They are both equally valid, and both are simplifications, like  any useful mental model has to be. If you are able to consider a piece of code from both of these perspectives, you will find it much easier to work through complicated code segments and understand why they do or do not compile and work as you expect.

Memory Regions

Now that you have a grip on how we refer to memory, we need to talk about what memory actually is. There are many different regions of memory, and perhaps surprisingly, not all of them are stored in the DRAM of your com- puter. Which part of memory you use has a significant impact on how you write your code. The three most important regions for the purposes of writ- ing Rust code are the stack, the heap, and static memory.

The Stack

The stack is a segment of memory that your program uses as scratch space for function calls. Each time a function is called, a contiguous chunk of memory called a frame is allocated at the top of the stack. Near the bottom of the stack is the frame for the main function, and as functions call other functions, additional frames are pushed onto the stack. A function’s frame contains all the variables within that function, along with any arguments the function takes. When the function returns, its stack frame is reclaimed.

The bytes that make up the values of the function’s local variables are not immediately wiped, but it’s not safe to access them as they may have been overwritten by a subsequent function call whose frame overlaps with the reclaimed one. And even if they haven’t been overwritten, they may con- tain values that are illegal to use, such as ones that were moved when the function returned.

Stack frames, and crucially the fact that they eventually disappear, are very closely tied to the notion of lifetimes in Rust. Any variable stored in a frame on the stack cannot be accessed after that frame goes away, so anyreference to it must have a lifetime that is at most as long as the lifetime of the frame.

**The Heap**

The heap is a pool of memory that isn’t tied to the current call stack of the program. Values in heap memory live until they are explicitly deallocated. This is useful when you want a value to live beyond the lifetime of the cur- rent function’s frame. If that value is the function’s return value, the calling function can leave some space on its stack for the called function to write that value into before it returns. But if you want to, say, send that value to a different thread with which the current thread may share no stack frames at all, you can store it on the heap.

The heap allows you to explicitly allocate contiguous segments of memory. When you do so, you get a pointer to the start of that segment  
of memory. That memory segment is reserved for you until you later deal- locate it; this process is often referred to as freeing, after the name of the corresponding function in the C standard library. Since allocations from the heap do not go away when a function returns, you can allocate memory for a value in one place, pass the pointer to it to another thread, and have that thread safely continue to operate on that value. Or, phrased differ- ently, when you heap-allocate memory, the resulting pointer has an uncon- strained lifetime—its lifetime is however long your program keeps it alive.

The primary mechanism for interacting with the heap in Rust is the Box type. When you write Box::new(value), the value is placed on the heap, and what you are given back (the Box<T>) is a pointer to that value on the heap. When the Box is eventually dropped, that memory is freed.

If you forget to deallocate heap memory, it will stick around forever, and your application will eventually eat up all the memory on your machine. This is called leaking memory and is usually something you want to avoid. However, there are some cases where you explicitly want to leak memory. For example, say you have a read-only configuration that the entire program should be able to access. You can allocate that on the heap and explicitly leak it with Box::leak to get a 'static reference to it.

**Static Memory**

Static memory is really a catch-all term for several closely related regions located in the file your program is compiled into. These regions are automatically loaded into your program’s memory when that program is executed. Values in static memory live for the entire execution of your pro- gram. Your program’s static memory contains the program’s binary code, which is usually mapped as read-only. As your program executes, it walks through the binary code in the text segment instruction by instruction and jumps around whenever a function is called. Static memory also holds the memory for variables you declare with the static keyword, as well as certain constant values in your code, like strings.

The special lifetime 'static, which gets its name from the static memory region, marks a reference as being valid for “as long as static memory is around,” which is until the program shuts down. Since a static variable’s memory is allocated when the program starts, a reference to a variable in static memory is, by definition, 'static, as it is not deallocated until the pro- gram shuts down. The inverse is not true—there can be 'static references that do not point to static memory—but the name is still appropriate: once you create a reference with a static lifetime, whatever it points to might as well be in static memory as far as the rest of the program is concerned, as it can be used for however long your program wishes.

You will encounter the 'static lifetime much more often than you will encounter truly static memory (through the static keyword, for example) when working with Rust. This is because 'static often shows up in trait bounds on type parameters. A bound like T: 'static indicates that the type parameter T is able to live for however long we keep it around for, up to and including the remaining execution of the program. Essentially, this bound requires that T is owned and self-sufficient, either in that it does not bor- row other (non-static) values or that anything it does borrow is also 'static and thus will stick around until the end of the program. A good example of 'static as a bound is the std::thread::spawn function that creates a new thread, which requires that the closure you pass it is 'static. Since the new thread may outlive the current thread, the new thread cannot refer to any- thing stored on the old thread’s stack. The new thread can refer only to values that will live for its entire lifetime, which may be for the remaining duration of the program.

You may wonder how const differs from static. The const keyword declares the fol- lowing item as constant. Constant items can be completely computed at compile time, and any code that refers to them is replaced with the constant’s computed value dur- ing compilation. A constant has no memory or other storage associated with it (it is not a place). You can think of constant as a convenient name for a particular value.

## Ownership

Rust’s memory model centers on the idea that all values have a single owner—that is, exactly one location (usually a scope) is responsible for ultimately deallocating each value. This is enforced through the borrow checker. If the value is moved, such as by assigning it to a new variable, pushing it to a vector, or placing it on the heap, the ownership of the value moves from the old location to the new one. At that point, you can no lon- ger access the value through variables that flow from the original owner, even though the bits that make up the value are technically still there. Instead, you must access the moved value through variables that refer to its new location.  

Some types are rebels and do not follow this rule. If a value’s type implements the special Copy trait, the value is not considered to have moved even if it is reassigned to a new memory location. Instead, the value is copied, and both the old and new locations remain accessible. Essentially, another identical instance of that same value is constructed at the destination of the move. Most primitive types in Rust, such as the integer and floating-point types, are Copy. To be Copy, it must be possible to duplicate the type’s values simply by copying their bits. This eliminates all types that contain non-Copy types as well as any type that owns a resource it must deallocate when the value is dropped.

To see why, consider what would happen if a type like Box were Copy. If we executed box2 = box1, then box1 and box2 would both believe that they owned the heap memory allocated for the box, and they would both attempt to free it when they went out of scope. Freeing the memory twice could have catastrophic consequences.

When a value’s owner no longer has use for it, it is the owner’s responsi- bility to do any necessary cleanup for that value by dropping it. In Rust, drop- ping happens automatically when the variable that holds the value is no longer in scope. Types usually recursively drop values they contain, so drop- ping a variable of a complex type may result in many values being dropped. Because of Rust’s discrete ownership requirement, we cannot accidentally drop the same value multiple times. A variable that holds a reference to another value does not own that other value, so the value isn’t dropped when the variable drops.

The code in Listing 1-3 gives a quick summary of the rules around own- ership, move and copy semantics, and dropping.

```rust
let x1 = 42;  
let y1 = Box::new(84); { // starts a new scope 1 
  let z = (x1, y1);
 	// z goes out of scope, and is dropped;
	// it in turn drops the values from x1 and y1 
}
// x1's value is Copy, so it was not moved into z
let x2 = x1;
// y1's value is not Copy, so it was moved into z
// let y2 = y1;
```

*Listing 1-3: Moving and copying semantics*

We start out with two values, the number 42 and a Box (a heap-allocated value) containing the number 84. The former is Copy, whereas the latter is not. When we place x1 and y1 into the tuple z 1, x1 is copied into z, whereas y1 is moved into z. At this point, x1 continues to be accessible and can be used again 3. On the other hand, y1 is rendered inaccessible once its value has been moved 4, and any attempt to access it would incur a compiler error. When z goes out of scope 2, the tuple value it contains is dropped, and this in turn drops the value copied from x1 and the one moved from y1. When the Box from y1 is dropped, it also deallocates the heap memory used to store y1’s value.

> DROP ORDER

> Rust automatically drops values when they go out of scope, such as x1 and y1 in the inner scope in Listing 1-3 . The rules for the order in which to drop are fairly simple: variables (including function arguments) are dropped in reverse order, and nested values are dropped in source-code order .

> This might sound weird at first—why the discrepancy? If we look at it closely, though, it makes a lot of sense . Say you write a function that declares a string and then inserts a reference to that string into a new hash table . When the function returns, the hash table must be dropped first; if the string were dropped first, the hash table would then hold an invalid reference! In general, later variables may contain references to earlier values, whereas the inverse cannot happen due to Rust’s lifetime rules . And for that reason, Rust drops vari- ables in reverse order .

> Now, we could have the same behavior for nested values, like the values in a tuple, array, or struct, but that would likely surprise users . If you constructed an array that contained two values, it’d seem odd if the last element of the array were dropped first . The same applies to tuples and structs, where the most intui- tive behavior is for the first tuple element or field to be dropped first, then the second, and so on . Unlike for variables, there is no need to reverse the drop order in this case, since Rust doesn’t (currently) allow self-references in a single value . So, Rust goes with the intuitive option .

## Borrowing and Lifetimes

Rust allows the owner of a value to lend out that value to others, without giving up ownership, through references. References are pointers that come with an additional contract for how they can be used, such as whether the reference provides exclusive access to the referenced value, or whether the referenced value may also have other references point to it.

### Shared References

A shared reference, &T, is, as the name implies, a pointer that may be shared. Any number of other references may exist to the same value, and each shared reference is Copy, so you can trivially make more of them. Values behind shared references are not mutable; you cannot modify or reassign the value a shared reference points to, nor can you cast a shared reference to a mutable one.

The Rust compiler is allowed to assume that the value a shared refer- ence points to will not change while that reference lives. For example, if the Rust compiler sees that the value behind a shared reference is read multiple times in a function, it is within its rights to read it only once and reuse that value. More concretely, the assertion in Listing 1-4 should never fail.

```rust
fn cache(input: &i32, sum: &mut i32) {
  *sum = *input + *input;
  assert_eq!(*sum, 2 * *input);
}
```

*Listing 1-4: Rust assumes that shared references are immutable.*

Whether or not the compiler chooses to apply a given optimization is more or less irrelevant. The compiler heuristics change over time, so you generally want to code against what the compiler is allowed to do rather than what it actually does in a particular case at a particular moment in time.

### Mutable References

The alternative to a shared reference is a mutable reference: &mut T. With mutable references, the Rust compiler is again allowed to make full use of the contract that the reference comes with: the compiler assumes that there are no other threads accessing the target value, whether through a shared reference or a mutable one. In other words, it assumes that the mutable reference is exclusive. This enables some interesting optimizations that are not readily available in other languages. Take, for example, the code in Listing 1-5.

```rust
fn noalias(input: &i32, output: &mut i32) {
  if *input == 1 {
		*output = 2; }
	if *input != 1 { *output = 3;
  } 
}
```

*Listing 1-5: Rust assumes that mutable references are exclusive.*

In Rust, the compiler can assume that input and output do not point to the same memory. Therefore, the reassignment of output at 1 cannot affect the check at 2, and the entire function can be compiled as a single if-else block. If the compiler could not rely on the exclusive mutability contract, that optimization would be invalid, since an input of 1 could then result in an output of 3 in a case like noalias(&x, &mut x).

A mutable reference lets you mutate only the memory location that  
the reference points to. Whether you can mutate values that lie beyond the immediate reference depends on the methods provided by the type that lies between. This may be easier to understand with an example, so consider Listing 1-6.

```rust
let x = 42;
let mut y = &x; // y is of type &i32
let z = &mut y; // z is of type &mut &i32
```

*Listing 1-6: Mutability applies only to the immediately referenced memory.*

In this example, you are able to change the value of the pointer y to a different value (that is, a different pointer) by making it reference a differ- ent variable, but you cannot change the value that is pointed to (that is, the value of x). Similarly, you can change the pointer value of y through z, but you cannot change z itself to hold a different reference.

The primary difference between owning a value and having a mutable reference to it is that the owner is responsible for dropping the value when it is no longer necessary. Apart from that, you can do anything through a mutable reference that you can if you own the value, with one caveat: if you move the value behind the mutable reference, then you must leave another value in its place. If you did not, the owner would still think it needed to drop the value, but there would be no value for it to drop!

Listing 1-7 gives an example of the ways in which you can move the value behind a mutable reference.

```rust
fn replace_with_84(s: &mut Box<i32>) {
  // this is not okay, as *s would be empty:
  // let was = *s;
	// but this is:
	let was = std::mem::take(s); 
  // so is this:
	*s = was;  
	// we can exchange values behind &mut: let mut r = Box::new(84);
	std::mem::swap(s, &mut r); 
  assert_ne!(*r, 84);
}
let mut s = Box::new(42);
replace_with_84(&mut s);
```

*Listing 1-7: Access through a mutable reference must leave a value behind.*

I’ve added commented-out lines that represent illegal operations. You cannot simply move the value out 1 since the caller would still think they owned that value and would free it again at 5, leading to a double free. If you just want to leave some valid value behind, std::mem::take 2 is a good can- didate. It is equivalent to std::mem::replace(&mut value, Default::default()); it moves value out from behind the mutable reference but leaves a new, default value for the type in its place. The default is a separate, owned value, so it is safe for the caller to drop it when the scope ends at 5.

Alternatively, if you don’t need the old value behind the reference, you can overwrite it with a value that you already own 3, leaving it to the caller to drop the value later. When you do this, the value that used to be behind the mutable reference is dropped immediately.

Finally, if you have two mutable references, you can swap their values without owning either of them 4, since both references will end up with a legal owned value for their owners to eventually free.



**Interior Mutability**

Some types provide interior mutability, meaning they allow you to mutate a value through a shared reference. These types usually rely on additional mechanisms (like atomic CPU instructions) or invariants to provide safe mutability without relying on the semantics of exclusive references. These normally fall into two categories: those that let you get a mutable reference through a shared reference, and those that let you replace a value given only a shared reference.

The first category consists of types like Mutex and RefCell, which con- tain safety mechanisms to ensure that, for any value they give a mutable reference to, only one mutable reference (and no shared references) can exist at a time. Under the hood, these types (and those like them) all rely on a type called UnsafeCell, whose name should immediately make you hesitate to use it. We will cover UnsafeCell in more detail in Chapter 9, but for now you should know that it is the only correct way to mutate through a shared reference.

Other categories of types that provide interior mutability are those that do not give out a mutable reference to the inner value but instead just give you methods for manipulating that value in place. The atomic integer types in std::sync::atomic and the std::cell::Cell type fall into this category. You cannot get a reference directly to the usize or i32 behind such a type, but you can read and replace its value at a given point in time.

*The Cell type in the standard library is an interesting example of safe interior muta- bility through invariants. It is not shareable across threads and never gives out a reference to the value contained in the Cell. Instead, the methods all either replace the value entirely or return a copy of the contained value. Since no references can exist to the inner value, it is always okay to move it. And since Cell isn’t shareable across threads, the inner value will never be concurrently mutated even though mutation happens through a shared reference.*

### Lifetimes

If you’re reading this book, you’re probably already familiar with the con- cept of lifetimes, likely through repeated notices from the compiler about lifetime rules violations. That level of understanding will serve you well for the majority of Rust code you will write, but as we dive deeper into the more complex parts of Rust, you will need a more rigorous mental model to work with.

Newer Rust developers are often taught to think of lifetimes as corresponding to scopes: a lifetime begins when you take a reference to some variable and ends when that variable is moved or goes out of scope. That’s often correct, and usually useful, but the reality is a little more complex. A lifetime is really a name for a region of code that some reference must be valid for. While a lifetime will frequently coincide with a scope, it does not have to, as we will see later in this section.

**Lifetimes and the Borrow Checker**

At the heart of Rust lifetimes is the borrow checker. Whenever a reference with some lifetime 'a is used, the borrow checker checks that 'a is still alive. It does this by tracing the path back to where 'a starts—where the reference was taken—from the point of use and checking that there are no conflict- ing uses along that path. This ensures that the reference still points to a value that it is safe to access. This is similar to the high-level “data flow” mental model we discussed earlier in the chapter; the compiler checks that the flow of the reference we are accessing does not conflict with any other parallel flows.

Listing 1-8 shows a simple code example with lifetime annotations for the reference to x.

``` rust
let mut x = Box::new(42);  
1 let r = &x; // 'a

if rand() > 0.5 {  
2 *x = 84;  
} else {  
3 println!("{}", r); // 'a }

4
```

*Listing 1-8: Lifetimes do not need to be contiguous.*

The lifetime starts at 1 when we take a reference to x. In the first branch 2, we then immediately try to modify x by changing its value to 84, which requires a &mut x. The borrow checker takes out a mutable reference to x and immediately checks its use. It finds no conflicting uses between when the reference was taken and when it was used, so it accepts the code. This may come as a surprise if you are used to thinking about lifetimes  as scopes, since r is still in scope at 2 (it goes out of scope at 4). But the borrow checker is smart enough to realize that r is never used later if this branch is taken, and therefore it is fine for x to be mutably accessed here. Or, phrased differently, the lifetime created at 1 does not extend into this branch: there is no flow from r beyond 2, and therefore there are no con- flicting flows. The borrow checker then finds the use of r in the print state- ment at 3. It walks the path back to 1 and finds no conflicting uses (2 is not on that path), so it accepts this use as well.

If we were to add another use of r at 4 in Listing 1-8, the code would no longer compile. The lifetime 'a would then last from 1 all the way until 4 (the last use of r), and when the borrow checker checked our new use of r, it would discover a conflicting use at 2.

Lifetimes can get quite convoluted. In Listing 1-9 you can see an example of a lifetime that has holes, where it’s intermittently invalid between where it starts and where it ultimately ends.

Foundations 13

```rust
let mut x = Box::new(42);

let mut z = &x;  // 'a
for i in 0..100 {   // 'a
	println!("{}", z); 3 x = Box::new(i);  // 'a
	z = &x;  
}  
println!("{}", z);  // 'a
```

*Listing 1-9: Lifetimes can have holes.*

The lifetime starts at 1 when we take a reference to x. We then move out of x at 3, which ends the lifetime 'a because it is no longer valid. The borrow checker accepts this move by considering 'a ended at 2, which leaves no conflicting flows from x at 3. Then, we restart the lifetime by updating the reference in z 4. Regardless of whether the code now loops back around to 2 or continues to the final print statement, both of those uses now have a valid value to flow from, and there are no conflicting flows, so the borrow checker accepts the code!

Again, this aligns perfectly with the data-flow model of memory we dis- cussed earlier. When x is moved, z stops existing. When we reassign z later, we are creating an entirely new variable that exists only from that point forward. It just so happens that that new variable is also named z. With that model in mind, this example is not weird.

The borrow checker is, and has to be, conservative. If it’s unsure whether a borrow is valid, it rejects it, as the consequences of allowing an invalid borrow could be disas- trous. The borrow checker keeps getting smarter, but there are times when it needs help to understand why a borrow is legal. This is part of why we have unsafe Rust.

Generic Lifetimes

Occasionally you need to store references within your own types. Those ref- erences need to have a lifetime so that the borrow checker can check their validity when they are used in the various methods on that type. This is especially true if you want a method on your type to return a reference that outlives the reference to self.

Rust lets you make a type definition generic over one or more lifetimes, just as it allows you to make it generic over types. The Rust Programming Language by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols (No Starch Press, 2018) covers this topic in some detail, so I won’t reiterate the basics here. But as you write more complex types of this nature, there are two subtleties around the interaction between such types and lifetimes that you should be aware of.

First, if your type also implements Drop, then dropping your type counts as a use of any lifetime or type your type is generic over. Essentially, when an instance of your type is dropped, the borrow checker will check that it’s still legal to use any of your type’s generic lifetimes before dropping it. This is necessary in case your drop code does use any of those references. If your type does not implement Drop, dropping the type does not count as a use, and users are free to ignore any references stored in your type as long as they do not use it anymore, like we saw in Listing 1-7. We’ll talk more about these rules around dropping in Chapter 9.

Second, while a type can be generic over multiple lifetimes, making it so often only serves to unnecessarily complicate your type signature. Usually, a type being generic over a single lifetime is fine, and the compiler will use the shorter of the lifetimes for any references inserted into your type as that one lifetime. You should only really use multiple generic life- time parameters if you have a type that contains multiple references, and its methods return references that should be tied to the lifetime of only one of those references.

Consider the type in Listing 1-10, which gives you an iterator over parts of a string separated by a particular other string.

```rust
struct StrSplit<'s, 'p> {
  delimiter: &'p str,
  document: &'s str,
}
impl<'s, 'p> Iterator for StrSplit<'s, 'p> {
  type Item = &'s str;
  fn next(&self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
		todo!() 
  }
}
fn str_before(s: &str, c: char) -> Option<&str> {
  StrSplit { document: s, delimiter: &c.to_string() }.next()
}
```

*Listing 1-10: A type that needs to be generic over multiple lifetimes*

When you construct this type, you have to give the delimiter and docu- ment to search, both of which are references to string values. When you ask for the next string, you get a reference into the document. Consider what would happen if you used a single lifetime in this type. The values yielded by the iterator would be tied to the lifetime of the document and the delimiter. This would make str_before impossible to write: the return type would have a lifetime associated with a variable local to the function—the String pro- duced by to_string—and the borrow checker would reject the code.

**Lifetime Variance**

Variance is a concept that programmers are often exposed to but rarely know the name of because it’s mostly invisible. At a glance, variance describes what types are subtypes of other types and when a subtype can be used in place of a supertype (and vice versa). Broadly speaking, a type A is a subtype of another type B if A is at least as useful as B. Variance is the rea- son why, in Java, you can pass a Turtle to a function that accepts an Animal if Turtle is a subtype of Animal, or why, in Rust, you can pass a &'static str to a function that accepts a &'a str.

While variance usually hides out of sight, it comes up often enough that we need to have a working knowledge of it. Turtle is a subtype of Animal because a Turtle is more “useful” than some unspecified Animal—a Turtle can do anything an Animal can do, and likely more. Similarly, 'static is a subtype of 'a because a 'static lives at least as long as any 'a and so is more useful. Or, more generally, if 'b: 'a ('b outlives 'a), then 'b is a subtype of 'a. This is obviously not the formal definition, but it gets close enough to be of practical use.

All types have a variance, which defines what other similar types can  be used in that type’s place. There are three kinds of variance: covariant, invariant, and contravariant. A type is covariant if you can just use a subtype in place of the type. For example, if a variable is of type &'a T, you can pro- vide a value of type &'static T to it, because &'a T is covariant in 'a. &'a T is also covariant in T, so you can pass a &Vec<&'static str> to a function that takes &Vec<&'a str>.

Some types are invariant, which means that you must provide exactly the given type. &mut T is an example of this—if a function takes a &mut Vec<&'a str>, you cannot pass it a &mut Vec<&'static str>. That is, &mut T is invariant in T. If you could, the function could put a short-lived string inside the Vec, which the caller would then continue using, thinking that it were a Vec<&'static str> and thus that the contained string were 'static! Any type that provides mutability is generally invariant for the same reason—for example, Cell<T> is invariant in T.

The last category, contravariance, comes up for function arguments. Function types are more useful if they’re okay with their arguments being less useful. This is clearer if you contrast the variance of the argument types on their own with their variance when used as function arguments:

```rust
  let x: &'static str; // more useful, lives longer
  let x: &'a      str; // less useful, lives shorter

  fn take_func1(&'static str) // stricter, so less useful
  fn take_func2(&'a str)// less strict, more useful
```



This flipped relationship indicates that Fn(T) is contravariant in T.

So why do you need to learn about variance when it comes to lifetimes? Variance becomes relevant when you consider how generic lifetime param- eters interact with the borrow checker. Consider a type like the one shown in Listing 1-11, which uses multiple lifetimes in a single field.

``` rust
struct MutStr<'a, 'b> {
    s: &'a mut &'b str
}

let mut s = "hello";  
1 *MutStr { s: &mut s }.s = "world";

println!("{}", s);
```

*Listing 1-11: A type that needs to be generic over multiple lifetimes*

At first glance, using two lifetimes here seems unnecessary—we have no methods that need to differentiate between a borrow of different parts of the structure, as we did with StrSplit in Listing 1-10. But if you replace the two lifetimes here with a single 'a, the code no longer compiles! And it’s all because of variance.

The syntax at 1 may seem alien. It’s equivalent to defining a variable x holding  a MutStr and then writing *x.s = "world", except that there’s no variable and so the MutStr is dropped immediately.

At 1, the compiler must determine what lifetime the lifetime para- meter(s) should be set to. If there are two lifetimes, 'a is set to the to-be- determined lifetime of the borrow of s, and 'b is set to 'static since that’s the lifetime of the provided string "hello". If there is just one lifetime 'a, the compiler infers that that lifetime must be 'static.

When we later attempt to access the string reference s through a shared reference to print it, the compiler tries to shorten the mutable borrow of s used by MutStr to allow the shared borrow of s.

In the two-lifetime case, 'a simply ends just before the println, and 'b stays the same. In the single-lifetime case, on the other hand, we run into issues. The compiler wants to shorten the borrow of s, but to do so, it would also have to shorten the borrow of the str. While &'static str can in general be shortened to any &'a str (&'a T is covariant in 'a), here it’s behind a &mut T, which is invariant in T. Invariance requires that the relevant type is never replaced with a sub- or supertype, so the compiler’s attempt to shorten the borrow fails, and it reports that the list is still mutably borrowed. Ouch!

Because of the reduced flexibility imposed by invariance, you want to ensure that your types remain covariant (or contravariant where appropri- ate) over as many of their generic parameters as possible. If that requires introducing additional lifetime arguments, you need to carefully weigh the cognitive cost of adding another parameter against the ergonomic cost of invariance.

## Summary

The aim of this chapter has been to establish a solid, shared foundation that we can build on in the chapters to come. By now, I hope you feel that you have a firm grasp on Rust’s memory and ownership model, and that those errors you may have gotten from the borrow checker seem less mys- terious. You might have known bits and pieces of what we covered here already, but hopefully the chapter has given you a more holistic image of how it all fits together. In the next chapter, we will do something similar for types. We’ll go over how types are represented in memory, see how gener- ics and traits produce running code, and take a look at some of the special type and trait constructs Rust offers for more advanced use cases.
